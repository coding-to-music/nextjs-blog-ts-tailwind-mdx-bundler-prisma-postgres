## Notable Features

This website was first initialized in January 2021, went through numerous changes and refactors, resulted to some notable features

### Dedicated Project Page

Each project is descriptively explained provided with my learnings.

### Blogs & Library

I write to teach people how to rebuild and redefine fundamental concepts through mental models.

# Fetch methods

https://nextjs-blog-ts-tailwind-mdx-bundler-prisma-postgres.vercel.app/blog/nextjs-fetch-method

https://theodorusclarence.com/blog/nextjs-fetch-method

- CSR - Client-Side Rendering, this is the usual kind of data fetching using useEffect, it will fetch the data from the API every single page request on the client-side (after the page is rendered, then the function will run).
- SSR - Server-Side Rendering, will run a special function to fetch data from API every page request on the server-side (before the page is loaded, that special function will run first, creating a delay, then after that, it will serve the page).
- SSG - Static Site Generation, will run a special function to fetch data once when that page builds.
- ISR - Incremental Static Regeneration, this is a new thing, shortly put, a combination of SSG, and SSR, where it served statically, but at a certain time and certain condition that page will rebuild and fetch the data from the API again.
- On-Demand Revalidation - This is not a data fetching method, but a way to trigger page rebuild for SSG and ISR. Starting from Next.js v12.2, you can have an API route that can trigger revalidate function.

## Prisma Setup

in `.env` change `DATABASE_URL=`

from

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://clarence:@localhost:5432/theodorusclarence"

to

`your database connection string`

Then migrate the Prisma schema to the new database

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Output

```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "databasename", schema "public" at "servername"

Applying migration `20220731131832_init`
Applying migration `20220902063121_add_like_and_views_session_id`

The following migration(s) have been applied:

migrations/
  â””â”€ 20220731131832_init/
    â””â”€ migration.sql
  â””â”€ 20220902063121_add_like_and_views_session_id/
    â””â”€ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

âœ” Generated Prisma Client (4.12.0 | library) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 240ms
```

## Spotify Setup

https://theodorusclarence.com/blog/spotify-now-playing

### Authenticate Your Account

To do authentication, we need to prepare CLIENT_ID and put it into this link below:

```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http
%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing
```

Output:

```
I was unable to get the `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` value, Spotify api just hung
```

When I did

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

and open the website in a browser (localhost:3000) I get this error:

```
    },
    data: {
      error: 'invalid_grant',
      error_description: 'Invalid refresh token'
    }
  },
  isAxiosError: true,
  toJSON: [Function: toJSON]
}
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
error Command failed with exit code 139.
```

Note that the original website has the Spotify widget removed, it is not visible (perhaps you need to be logged in to view it??)

## Umami (similar to Google Analytics) Setup

`.env` variable

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=
```

`/src/pages/_documment.tsx` uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`

```
data-website-id={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID || ''}
src='https://umami.thcl.dev/umami.js'
data-domains='theodorusclarence.com'
```
